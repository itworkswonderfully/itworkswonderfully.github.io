      <em>
        In an <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2015/10/it-works-wonderfully">October 2015 General Conference address</a>, Dieter Uchtdorf, a member of the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints posed the question:
        <br />
        “When it comes to spiritual truth, how can we know that we are on the right path?  One way is by asking the right questions—the kind that help us ponder our progress and evaluate how things are working for us. Questions like:”
        <ul>
          <li>“When it comes to spiritual truth, how can we know that we are on the right path?”</li>
          <li>“Does my life have meaning?”</li>
          <li>“Do I believe in God?”</li>
          <li>“Do I believe that God knows and loves me?”</li>
          <li>“Do I believe that God hears and answers my prayers?”</li>
          <li>“Am I truly happy?”</li>
          <li>“Are my efforts leading me to the highest spiritual goals and values in life?”</li>
          <li>“Is my experience in the Church working for me? Is it bringing me closer to Christ? Is it blessing me and my family with peace and joy as promised in the gospel?”</li>
          <li>“Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts? And can you feel it now?” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14,26">Book of Mormon, Alma 5:14, 26</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>President Uchtdorf continued, “Many members will answer with great warmth that their experience as a member of the Church is working exceptionally well for them... 
          But I also recognize that there are some who have a less-than-fulfilling experience—who feel that their membership in the Church sometimes isn’t quite what they had hoped for.”</p>
        <ul>
          <li>“Why does it seem to work better for some than for others?”</li>
          <li>“What is the difference between those whose experience in the Church fills their souls with songs of redeeming love and those who feel that something is lacking?”</li>
        </ul>
